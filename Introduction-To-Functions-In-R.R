# Exercise 1
# Create a function to calculate the circumference of a circle with a known radius using the formula 2Ï€r. In this 
# example the function has only one parameter, namely r. After defining the function, we will call it with a 
# radius equal to 2, i.e., with the argument {2}.

myFunction1 <- function(radius) {
  return(2*pi*radius)
}

myFunction1(2);
