# Exercise 1
# Create a function to calculate the circumference of a circle with a known radius using the formula 2Ï€r. In this 
# example the function has only one parameter, namely r. After defining the function, we will call it with a 
# radius equal to 2, i.e., with the argument {2}.

myFunction1 <- function(radius) {
  return(2*pi*radius)
}

myFunction1(2);

# Exercise 2
# Write a function to calculate the following: f(x, y) = (x^(2) + y(2))^(1/2) for 
# x = 1,2, ,10 , y = 1,2, ,10 and x = y
myFunction2 <- function(x, y) {
  return(sqrt(x^(2)+y^(2)));
}

myFunction2(1:10, 1:10);

# Exercise 3
# Write a function to calculate f(x, y) = sqrt(x^(2), y^(2)) and f(x, y) = sqrt(x * y)
# for f(2,4) and f(3,2). Use the list() function to combine the output of the two formulae in the return() function. 
# Assign the function to an object, assess the structure, and call the output for each component of the list.
myFunction3 <- function(x, y) {
  output1 = sqrt(x^(2) + y^(2));
  output2 = sqrt(x * y);
  return(list("Square root of sum of squares" = output1, "Square root of product" = output2));
}

myFunction3(2,4);
